# END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (E.U.L.A.)

**Effective Date: 2025/07/16**

---

## 1. AGREEMENT OVERVIEW

This End User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal contract between you (“User” or “You”) and Lakr233 and Lessica (“Developers” or “We”) regarding your use of TrollNFC (巨魔 NFC) (“Software” or “Application”).

By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you agree to be bound by this Agreement.

## 2. SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION

TrollNFC is a specialized iPhone utility application designed for Near Field Communication (NFC) operations. The Software provides comprehensive functionality for interacting with high-frequency IC cards, enabling users to read card data, write information to compatible cards, create copies of existing cards, and emulate card behavior. The application supports various industry-standard protocols, with primary support for ISO-14443/A and related communication standards.

## 3. LICENSE GRANT

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Software solely for personal, non-commercial purposes.

## 4. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

To ensure optimal performance and compatibility, TrollNFC requires specific system configurations:

**Device Compatibility**: The Software is exclusively designed for iPhone devices and does not support iPad or other iOS devices due to hardware-specific NFC implementations.

**Operating System**: Your device must be running iOS version 14.0 through 17.0. Devices with newer or older iOS versions may experience compatibility issues or complete inability to function.

**Installation Method**: TrollNFC requires TrollStore to be properly installed and configured on your device, as the application is distributed outside the App Store ecosystem.

**Network Requirements**: While the Software operates primarily offline, an internet connection is necessary during initial setup for subscription authentication and when restoring previous purchases.

**System Modification Risks**: TrollNFC operates within TrollStore or jailbroken environments, which inherently modify standard iOS behavior. This operational requirement may result in interference with your device’s native NFC capabilities and related services. Potential impacts include but are not limited to:

- Disruption of iPhone’s built-in NFC reading functionality for contactless payments, transit cards, and other NFC-enabled services
- Impaired or completely non-functional Apple Pay and Apple Wallet services
- Reduced reliability of contactless payment transactions at terminals
- Potential conflicts with other NFC-dependent applications and system services

By installing and using TrollNFC, you explicitly acknowledge that you have been informed of these potential system impacts and accept full responsibility for any resulting functionality degradation. The Developers assume no liability for interference with native iOS features or any inconvenience caused by such interference.

## 5. SUBSCRIPTION TERMS

TrollNFC operates under an annual subscription model designed to provide ongoing access and support:

**Billing Cycle**: Subscriptions are billed on a yearly basis at $9.99 USD per 12-month period, providing full access to all current and future features during the subscription period.

**Device Binding**: Each subscription is permanently bound to your device’s Unique Device Identifier (UDID) upon first activation. Once activated, the subscription cannot be transferred to another device under any circumstances. If you change devices, you will need to purchase a new subscription for the new device.

**Payment Processing**: All subscription transactions are securely processed through Creem’s subscription management platform, which handles payment authorization, processing, and subscription lifecycle management.

**Automatic Renewal**: To ensure uninterrupted service, subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless explicitly cancelled by the user before the renewal date.

**Cancellation Policy**: Users maintain full control over their subscription status and may cancel at any time through their Creem account management interface. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.

**Refund Policy**: Refunds are subject to Creem’s standard refund policies and applicable consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction. Please note that device changes do not qualify for refunds due to the UDID binding nature of the service.

## 6. PROHIBITED USES

You agree NOT to use the Software for:

- Any commercial, business, or revenue-generating activities
- Illegal copying, cloning, or counterfeiting of access cards, payment cards, or identification documents
- Unauthorized access to secured facilities, systems, or services
- Any activity that violates local, national, or international laws and regulations
- Circumventing security measures or access controls
- Creating or distributing malicious NFC tags
- Any purpose that could harm individuals, organizations, or property

## 7. USER RESPONSIBILITIES

You are solely responsible for:

- Ensuring compliance with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction
- Obtaining proper authorization before reading, writing, or emulating any NFC cards
- Any consequences arising from your use of the Software

## 8. DATA COLLECTION AND PRIVACY

The Software is designed with privacy as a core principle and does not collect, store, or transmit personal user data. Network communication is strictly limited to essential subscription verification processes and purchase restoration functionality. No user activity, card data, or device information is collected or shared with third parties.

## 9. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

All rights, title, and interest in the Software remain with the Developers. This Agreement does not grant you ownership rights to the Software.

## 10. DISCLAIMERS

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE DEVELOPERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE.

## 12. TERMINATION

This Agreement terminates automatically if you breach any terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use and delete the Software.

## 13. UPDATES AND MODIFICATIONS

We reserve the right to enhance and evolve the Software to meet changing user needs and technological advances:

- Expand compatibility to support additional NFC card types and communication protocols
- Implement optional data collection features with explicit user consent and transparent disclosure
- Introduce additional network-based functionality while maintaining user privacy
- Update this Agreement as necessary, with 30 days advance notice provided to users

Continued use after modifications constitutes acceptance of updated terms.

## 14. GOVERNING LAW

This Agreement is governed by the laws of Jiangning District, Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, People’s Republic of China.
